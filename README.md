# Typing Game

## Intro

Hello! I am Pinak Dwivedi.

## Description

I have created this project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This is a typing game with a very nice, simple, and compelling UI.

### How To Play

At first, the player is shown a dialog with a time field where they can choose the time period for how long they want to type, and there is a passage field where they can choose which passage they want to type.
Then, once the player is done selecting time and passage, they can click the start button to start the game.
The player can now see the passage they selected on the screen, a timer on the top left indicating how much time is left, and a blank area where they have to type the passage above.
Once the player starts typing, the timer also starts.
The word in the passage with a green background means the player has to type this word, if they type it correctly, the green background will be removed from the word, and if they type the word wrong, it will get a red background, indicating they typed the word wrong. In either case, the next word in the passage will have a green background.
When the timer ends, the player can now see the results of how they played. There will be information about the player's typing speed in words per minute, accuracy, and how many correct and wrong words the player typed. And there will be a reset game button to play again.
When the player clicks the reset game button, they are taken back to the dialog.
