    title: "Andrea the Duck Grows Up",
    passage: `Andrea Duck had just climbed ashore. Because the sun was so warm, she decided to have a quick nap. She carefully balanced on one leg and tucked her head under her wings. Just before she fell asleep, she remembered the time when she was still a tiny, yellow ball of fluff. Andrea the Duckling!
    Suddenly she saw herself as a tiny duckling in the water. Swimming in the big, beautiful world of wind and sun. But she also noticed the dark reeds she had to swim through as a duckling. And where she knew there were rats waiting for little ducklings like her. They could suddenly pull you down into the water by your legs, and… Andrea remembered how, as a young duck, she couldn't control all her muscles like other little ducklings could. She had not yet learned how to use her webbed feet properly. And that became painfully obvious one terrible day. Right at the moment when she wanted to show mother duck how clever and independent she already was. That was a really awful day!
    But she found something! In order to prove herself different, and not just a tiny duckling who was sometimes really scared by the big watery world, she had invented something. Something she had discovered quite by accident.
    She had discovered that she only had to peep 'Fletch' or 'Flatch' instead of quacking like a normal duckling. If she peeped 'Fletch' or 'Flatch', all the other young ducks put their heads together and started to quack,
    "Have you heard? Andrea said 'Fletch' and even 'Flatch'!"
    To Andrea's astonishment, every time she peeped 'Fletch' or 'Flatch', all the other ducks quacked about it. So then she made up 'Flotch' and 'Flutch' and that had even more success. It wasn't until later that she understood that, in duck language, these were naughty words.
    Andrea the duck was almost asleep in the warm sun, with her head under her wings, but she had to grin at the memory of all this. It was actually very clever of the little duckling Andrea. And when she had grown up and become a young duck who could manage her webbed feet perfectly, she had found other ways of expressing herself. Saying 'Fletch', 'Flatch', 'Flotch' and 'Flutch' got lots of reactions, but not exactly the reaction she wanted.
    What did she really want? Was it to make lots of noise with the other young ducks, and to pinch their strong little bodies with her beak? Was it to throw mud at them with her webbed feet? Or was it just to chat with them? To tell the others clearly what she felt and thought?
    If the slightly older drakes were teasing her, she wanted to learn to shake off their words, in the same way that a duck shakes off drops of water from its feathers. She'd had to learn to do that - shake off all the drops of water - but imagine being able to do that with the drakes' teasing! Just to shake it all off! That would surprise them! That was a much better way of getting to them than pinching them with her beak. Andrea thought back and was very satisfied with her behavior as a young duck - she wasn't stupid! Not at all!
    Andrea knew that she could now express herself really clearly, and she wondered how and when she learned this, that clear quacking she could now do. She couldn't remember; it must have happened of its own accord. She no longer found it interesting to use 'Fletch', 'Flatch', 'Flotch' and 'Flutch'. Whichever way you looked at it, they were not clear quacking in duck language.
    By now Andrea was fast asleep with her head under her wings, in the big outdoor world where the reeds rustled gently and the birds sang tirelessly. The sun shone warm on Andrea's head, and the rays were mirrored in the rippling of the water.
    If you see Andrea there in the grass, standing strongly on one leg, then you can be so pleased to see that she has grown beautifully! And you can understand at once how she discovers more of the world each and every day, learning to express herself better, with more and more self-confidence, without needing to use naughty duck words.`,

    title: "Butterfly: An Autumn Meditation for Kids",
    passage: `One morning, you open your eyes to feel a cool breeze on your face.
    The summer has been so long that you've forgotten a little how it feels to be in autumn. What the air smells like and how it makes you feel: crisp, windy. It makes you feel like dancing, like a little tumbleweed on a blowy, grassy hill.
    But now there is a cool sensation on your face, and you realize that autumn has arrived. You push your bedclothes back and jump out of bed. You open the window and put your face to the morning.
    The earth is covered in a carpet of orange, red and brown. Here comes Fall. How beautiful it is! Can you smell the deep, wet earth? Can you feel the cool bite to the morning, before the sun warms everything up?
    You pull on a jacket and shoes, and walk gently outside. It is completely silent, save for the powerful rustle and swish of the tall trees surrounding your house as their branches move in the wind. Those smooth boughs and russet-coloured leaves seem to speak to one another and to you; their sound is soothing, like a deep sigh from the belly.
    You can hear the crunch of crunchy leaves beneath your feet. Then you stop, and notice the sound of the geese as they sweep strongly above your head. Their wings plunge through the air, and their single note of a squawk lifts in the wind, then dies away as they pass.
    But now! In the silence of this quiet morning, you see so much more. The tiny red rose-hips quiver on their branches. The summer flowers hang heavily, readying to slumber. The thin light of the cold morning sunshine gleams on dewdrops, glistening like jewels on the drooping leaves.
    The sky starts pale, and deepens where the night has not yet turned to day. There are the faintest wisps of clouds about the horizon. The translucent mark of the moon on the brightening sky, like a stamp, which get paler as the sun rises, and the heavens turn light.
    It is then that you see something miraculous. A brilliant blue butterfly wafts across the damp, cold grass. It hovers up and down as though caught on invisible currents of air. It darts through the bushes as though searching for something magical; what is it? You cannot begin to guess.
    You begin to follow this beautiful blue butterfly through the garden, into the forest. It glimmers like a tiny colourful light, sometimes appearing, sometimes disappearing between the calm grey boughs of trees.
    You wonder as you follow it... is it taking you somewhere? Will you discover a teddy bear's picnic? A fairy feast? A hollow tree, where on looking closer, studded within, there is a tiny, enchanted door...?
    The sun is higher now; a promise of warmth, just the tiniest bit of warmth; all the sun can muster in these cool, sleeping seasons. But the gentle trees still hug you as though in a shady embrace.
    You hear your breath - in, out, in, out - as your footsteps echo from the forest floor. The blue butterfly swirls as though it dances with you and the air.
    Finally it stops, in a sweet grove of stones and soft moss, thyme and lavender, dry now that summer has passed. It lends a sweet, tranquil perfume to the air. You sink to your knees, and the butterfly hovers up. It seems to kiss you on the tip of your nose, then lands on the end of your finger.
    Can you see how beautiful its wings are, up close? They are beset with little patterns of black and silver, as beautiful as a drawing that someone spent a year on.
    Now you are closer to the ground, you can also see how the leaves, orange, red, and brown, also have these delicate features, as though someone drew them on: feathery textures, flashes of colour, and where the rain has kissed them, deep black patches which will one day turn to soil, and grow new trees anew.
    How lovely it would be, you think then, to just sink to this soft bed of moss and loop up at the swaying trees and cold, bright sky. And so you do. There is no one to stop you. And no reason at all why you shouldn't do just as you please.
    You lie on your back, cocooned by the peacefulness of this little forest spot. You close your eyes for a moment and feel how warm you are in your jacket, cosy and soft. You are so safe and comfortable here.
    Lying here like this, you listen, too, to the sounds of nature around your. The wind as it sighs through the forest canopy. The soft hum of insects which have not quite yet gone to sleep for the winter. And then - magically - the tiny crunch of ants carrying the last of their summer harvest to their snug holes, before the long winter's rest.
    Now take a deep breath. Feel the clean, fresh forest air fil your lungs with all that is good and alive. As you breathe out, all your worries whoosh out with the breath.
    You do this a few times. In - that beautiful, pristine morning autumn air. Out - there goes everything that has every made you sad or worried or lonely.
    It's a beautiful thing, breathing like this, in this safe, protected forest of your mind.
    And now - as the sun finally burst into dawn, you can feel the soft, warm glow of light bathing your entire body. How comforting it is! How peaceful you are! You lay there as long as you want. And when you are ready, you open your eyes once more.
    You say a silent farewell to the little butterfly, which still wafts around damp tree-stumps and final flowers.
    Then you walk softly back to your home, your footfall making gentle sounds on the leafy carpet of the forest path.
    When you see your home, the lights are on, and you know that breakfast is on its way. Warm drinks and all the foods you love best are arranged on the table, waiting for you.
    And you know that the day will go on, and you will carry the seeds of this miraculous autumn morning with you for all the hours to come. The cool, cosy, quiet glory of the seasons turning, and the vast eternity within you.`,

    title: "Jessy The Heron Waits For His Fish",
    passage: `Jessy is a heron, and the one thing herons have to do is fish!
  One particular Sunday, Jessy was standing on his long legs staring into the murky water, right next to the bridge beside the quacking ducks in the park. Fishing is done standing up. That's what his father had taught him in the fields and streams, and that was what Jessy did.
  "Just stand on your long legs and wait until a delicious snack with a tail comes swimming past," his father had said. "A fish or perhaps even a frog! As soon as you see it, step slowly and carefully towards the fish without moving the water, and then: SNAP! with your long beak. It's sad for the fish, but a heron must eat!"
  So on this Sunday morning, Jessy was fishing in the park just by the noisy ducks and geese, who were busy trying to eat the bread thrown by the walking visitors. Above the stream, there were gulls circling and squawking.
  Jessy loved to watch the gulls in the air. He was quite jealous of their art of flying. But he didn't like their bread. He never even looked up when people threw bread for the birds. Of course the ducks and geese did; they flapped over, quacking like mad.
  But a heron waits only for his fish, and that was why Jessy was staring into the dark water. He wasn't going to be disturbed by anything or anyone on this sunny winter afternoon.
  As the geese gobbled up everything, swimming towards the bread with their fat stomachs, they gossiped about that peculiar heron.
  "How stupid he is - just standing and waiting. He thinks the fish will swim to him as though he's in the country fields! But this here is the city! In the city everything moves fast, even the fish. So you must snap them up quickly and move off. That heron doesn't understand anything. I bet he's new in town."
  Laughing, the geese nudged one another and went on gossiping and eating.
  "What is the heron looking for here? It's far too busy here for fish. Perhaps he's looking for frogs? But the frogs all have been eaten by other local herons already. They are real city dwellers, they don't stand and just wait. They dive from the tree into the water and SNAP! the fish are gone!"
  Yes, all the geese had something to say about the heron, as the water spattered off their fat bellies. But Jessy took no notice, and remained where he was, standing a few feet from the bridge, staring into the murky waters, waiting for his fish.
  In the distance a mobility scooter appeared. It was Mr. Noiseman. He rode in the scooter because his legs no longer worked properly. It was an electric scooter - it didn't smell of petrol and it could go really fast. In the neighbourhood where he lived, people called him the 'Wildman on Wheels'. Indeed, even though he couldn't walk anymore, Mr Noiseman was young, and still quite wild and free.
  On this Sunday, Noiseman fancied racing fast through the park. In fact, he was really too late for that. By now the park would be quite full of walking people. Never mind! He would drive carefully and he could steer very well.
  Mr Noiseman liked to have some fun, which was one of the reasons he'd bought his scooter. It cost quite a lot of money, but it could drive really fast. It had one small wheel at the front, and two larger ones at the back. It looked good too. He could sit comfortably in the seat and feel the motor throbbing while he was driving. He loved it!
  There were lots of bridges and bends in the park. Mr Noiseman really enjoyed driving fast over the bridges and around the bends. Especially on a Sunday, when there were lots of local people to watch him. He didn't want to hurt anyone, he just wanted to show off a bit. Otherwise the Sundays were just so lazy and boring.
  He knew exactly what to do to make sure everyone watched him. If he accelerated just before the bend and then raced around on one back wheel whilst his other wheel balanced in the air - then they would certainly all watch!
  He'd often done it before and the gravel made a loud noise. And people could hear him coming and move out of the way. It gave him such a powerful feeling, hanging on one side for a couple of seconds and then bouncing back onto the ground again. Oh, he loved that, and all the more when people watched him and cheered.
  Hooting his hooter, Mr Noiseman rode into the park. He went straight onto the big bridge. The bend after the bridge was really sharp, and the path ran on beside the water. Oh, that place was so exciting!! First, though, he had to make a lot of noise with his hooter, to warn people to get out of the way.
  After hooting his horn, Mr Noiseman went over the bridge at full speed. The wheels of his scooter made a great sound on the wooden boards. It sounded almost like a train! Then he raced fast down the bridge on the other side, and as fast as possible through the bend! He knew he had to steer carefully, because then he could race along beside the stream to frighten the geese. Sometimes they would hiss angrily at him and Mr Noiseman thought that made it even more fun.
  Just around the bend behind the bridge, Jessy the Heron was fishing. From the corner of his eye he saw Noiseman racing towards him. What on earth was this? An idiot heading straight for the stream where he, Jessy, was fishing!
  Oh yes, Jessy was right. Mr Noiseman had accelerated on the bridge and the path was still a bit slippery from the frost. Mr Noiseman never followed the weather forecast so he had no idea it had been frosty that morning. As he drove down the bridge, his scooter started to slip and slide. Luckily all the people had fled from the bridge as they saw everything going wrong.
  Mr Noiseman couldn't keep the scooter in the bend. It started to spin out of control! He saw the treetops spinning round, and no longer knew where he was. It was lucky the scooter didn't fall over. Instead it drove off the path and into the grass towards the stream… towards Jessy the Heron!
  Mr Noiseman and his scooter landed in the water with a big splash, right in front of the astonished Jessy, who started to hiss at him. Luckily the water had slowed down the scooter or else he would have crashed really hard into Jessy. Two dark beady eyes looked at him threateningly across the water. The heron was really angry and my word, what an enormous beak he had! Right up close, Mr Noiseman saw this size for the first time.
  Before he had time to be really scared, Mr Noiseman noticed how his expensive mobility scooter was gradually sinking down deeper into the cold water. Air bubbles were coming up to the surface of the stream. All the ducks and geese had seen Mr Noiseman coming, and had immediately flown off with a great deal of indignant noise!
  "That's the idiot in that hooting scooter. Oh we know him, alright! He always races around scaring people, but he never brings us any bread. Always teasing us… it serves him right. Haha, look at him now!"
  But Jessy didn't fly off; he stayed exactly where he was. He was hungry so he needed to fish. He walked threateningly towards Mr Noiseman to scare him off. But Mr Noiseman couldn't go anywhere. He was stuck in his seat in the cold water.
  He closed his eyes so he couldn't see what was happening. People along the edge of the water started to shout and call out. Mr Noiseman could hear them all around him. He felt very ashamed, but there was nothing he could do now in his wet and sinking scooter.
  Slowly he felt the cold water rising in his clothes and up to his neck. Oh, it was so cold and so muddy! And all the time the heron's long beak and beady eyes were looking at him. What was the silly bird going to do? Oh, no - not that…!
  Noisily Jessy flew out of the water and landed on Mr Noiseman's head. He could feel the heron's claws gripping into his hat and hair.
  Jessy didn't know why, but with one beat of his wings he had hopped onto Mr Noiseman's head. From his new vantage point, he looked in amazement at all the local people pointing and calling. They made such a noise together!
  This was all too much for Jessy, who was shocked; so he dropped a large white heron poop on Mr Noiseman's head!
  'Dirty bird!" Noiseman screamed under him. He could feel the poop slipping down his hair into his neck, but then he shut his mouth. He didn't want to make the heron any angrier; he was afraid of the long beak.
  From the sidelines people were laughing and shouting. Everyone wanted to see this. A heron standing on someone's head is not something you see every day. Jessy seemed quite happy up there; he wasn't making any move to go elsewhere.
  Other people watching felt sorry for Mr Noiseman, but they couldn't see how they could help him without getting themselves wet. Luckily a couple of young men walked over to the water to lift Mr Noiseman out of his scooter. That wasn't easy because as soon as they got close, the heron's beak pointed dangerously near to them. So they were forced to take a few steps back again. It was a strange sight to see how a thin little heron could keep five, fit young men at a distance.
  What about Mr Noiseman?
  Well he kept vey still, but suddenly he got an idea. Earlier this morning he had made himself some salmon sandwiches to eat in the park. He could feed them to the heron, because that scraggly thin bird must be really hungry by now.
  Mr Noiseman managed to get the parcel of sandwiches out of his wet coat pocket and threw it into the grass beside the water.
  "There's fish in there - he'll come and get it!" he shouted.
  The young men understood Mr Noiseman straight away, but Jessy was even quicker. Before the parcel of sandwiches had even landed, he had flown from his perch on Mr Noiseman's head and was busy opening the parcel with his beak. He could smell the salmon. It was smoked salmon! Jessy didn't get to eat that very often!
  Mr Noiseman shouted happily and waved his arms in the air. The heron had flown off his head and the young men could come and help him out of the water.
  Jessy allowed nothing to disturb his enjoyment of the salmon. One by one he picked the pieces of pink salmon from the sandwiches - he didn't want the bread - just the salmon. So the geese flew in for the bread and looked at the heron in astonishment. "Look at that - he's got his fish. How did he manage that? Are there fish in our water? He's a really smart heron!" But the geese had to wait for Jessy to finish the salmon before they could eat the bread. That is the order of things!
  Now Mr Noiseman could safely be taken out of the water, he stretched out his arms and the young men were able to pull him out of his scooter. His clothes were all dripping wet with the muddy water. They laid him down on the grass while they went to see if they could rescue his expensive mobility scooter. That was no easy task as it had heavy batteries and the wheels were stuck in the mud. But they managed, and the scooter stood next to Mr Noiseman on the grass, dripping muddy water. Then the young men picked up Mr Noiseman and put him upright in the scooter again.
  There was loud applause from the bridge and from the edge of the water. Everyone was pleased that the young man had been rescued from the water. And happy Mr Noiseman was very glad to be sitting on his scooter again. He waved his hat at his rescuers to thank them, and the spectators understood and applauded again. Then Mr Noiseman pointed to the heron, still busy eating his salmon. Everybody was laughing and applauded again, now just for Jessy.
  Thankfully, a couple of Mr Noiseman's neighbors were also in the park and they were willing to help him home. They saw how he was shivering with the cold and suffering from shock. It could all have been a lot worse. He now needed to get home fast for a warm shower and clean clothes.
  The neighbours helped him by pushing the scooter, which was of course totally waterlogged, and held on to the shivering Mr Noiseman as they left the park. Jessy watched everything as he had now finished all the salmon. So with a loud squawk he flew up and followed the group out of the park.
  Once home, a neighbour opened the door and they pushed Mr Noiseman and the scooter into the warm corridor. A couple went inside with him to help and the front door was closed.
  From the air Jessie had seen a convenient lamp-post in front of the house, and he landed on his thin legs on the top. It was comfortable up there, and he had a good view and was safe from people and dogs. He tried to see in through the windows to see where that Salmon Man was now. Jessy stayed until it got dark, and then he flew back to his sleeping tree in the park.
  The next morning, Jessy came back to his lamp-post early. After waiting for hours, at last the front door was opened and he saw Mr Noiseman drive out. He squawked angrily.
  Mr Noiseman laughed when he saw the heron looking down from the lamp-post with his beady eyes. He had spotted him straight away, and had come out prepared with a parcel of salmon. He accelerated his scooter, happy that everything had dried out and was working once again, and he set off for the park with Jessy flying behind him.
  Since that day Mr Noiseman never drives on his own. Wherever he goes, Jessy goes too. Somewhere in the air above his head. They are always together outside.
  From that day on, his neighbors in the street all call Mr Noiseman the 'Wild Salmon Man', as he feeds salmon to Jessy every day on the bridge in the park.
  Mr Noiseman still enjoys racing fast through the park, but only when it's quiet now, because Herons don't like it when its busy!`,

    title: "Bear of the Woods",
    passage: `Once upon a time, in the farthest reaches of remote villages, there lived a little girl named Breeze.
    Breeze had a big and loving family. Breeze was the youngest of three siblings. She had to older brothers. Her grandparents were also living with them. She dad her mother, father and her beloved dog, Latte, with her. What else could a little girl need in this world? Her whole family loved her, and Breeze loved them, too. She was sure they would lead a happy life together.
    Breeze's family home was in a village at the foot of the largest mountain in the country. An emerald creek flowed right next to their house. Turtles and crabs tiptoeing out of that creek would slowly find their way to Breeze's house, where it was warm and safe. Breeze was not afraid of any animal; she loved all animals as much as she loved Latte.
    Breeze's dad was a woodcutter. He used to go to the forest early every morning till evening, and cut down the old trees that were about to migrate from this world. He cut down only the oldest, dying trees. He never touched young and healthy trees. Therefore, the balance of the forest was never disturbed. In this way, the forest had always been home to many animals, as well as a cheerful lush forest full of trees.
    Breeze's older brothers went to school every day. Breeze didn't go to school because she was younger. However, she was eager to grow up and go to school with her brothers as soon as possible.
    Breeze's Grandfather, meanwhile, spent most of his days in the village. There were children in the village without parents. Grandfather would take care of them from morning to night, telling them stories.
    The arrival of Breeze's grandfather, father and older brothers after a long day in the village would take place after dark. By this time, Breeze would be at home with her mother and grandmother. Of course, Latte was also with them.
    Grandma knew herbs very well. She would describe them to Breeze's dad, and he would collect medicinal herbs from the forest and bring them to Grandma. Grandma made panacea ointments and syrups with those herbs. Whoever got sick in the village came to her first. Her gentle knowledge healed the patient immediately. She had a whole room full of ointment and syrup, and she spent all her days making them with real tenderness.
    Breeze's mother, on the other hand, took care of the housework and tried to keep their house clean and warm at all times. She cooked delicious meals, and played games with Breeze in her spare time.
    Right next to Breeze and her family's house, there was a steep path leading into the woods. In the spring, both sides of the path were filled with mountain strawberries. Breeze, her mother, and latte would all walk along the path and pick wild strawberries. However, they always turned around before entering the forest.
    Breeze's mother was afraid of animals in the forest. Breeze was never afraid, but her mother was. Her fear was not because she did not love them. In fact, she loved the animals in the forest and in the stream as much as she loved Latte. She didn't want any animals to get hurt, but she couldn't touch all of them like Breeze. She also though that the animals in the forest could be dangerous.
    Breeze couldn't understand her mother's fear, but she couldn't help her with it, either. Unlike her mother, she stroked crabs and kissed turtles. Breeze even loved bugs. She wouldn't let anyone kill the bugs. She would immediately catch the insect and protect it in her palms. Then she would rush out and drop the insect on the ground. And she said:
    "This is your home, little bug! You must be on the ground, not in our house. Come on now, got to your family and don't go into people's houses again, okay? I don't want anyone to hurt you."
    Breeze loved animals very much. A lot! If possible, she could gather all the animals in her house and play with them from morning to night. Everyone loved animals, but Breeze loved them more than anyone. Even in her dreams, she would jump rope with goats and kangaroos, and play hide and seek with wolves and hyenas. The dreams in which she would climb trees with the help of elephant trunks and having tea parties with monkeys were her favourite dreams.
    That's why, whenever turtles and crabs came out of the creek near their house, Breeze would immediately put Latte on the ground next to the, take out the toy tea sets, and play tea parties with them. Latte did not harm the turtle and crab at all. First she would take a sniff, then she would sit quietly in her place.
    Breeze drank tea with them for a long time. On the other hand, she could never be quiet, she was always telling stories to the animals. The animals listened carefully to Breeze. They just stood there without moving. Breeze would put some cookies in front of Latte, some lettuce in front of the turtle, and some algae she picked up from the creek in front of the crab. They would enjoy tea together. The game would continue until her mother called Breeze. When mother called; Breeze would get up softly, collect the tea sets and go to her mother. Latte followed, too. Crab and turtle would return to the creek.
    Breeze knew animals like crabs, turtles, goats, and dogs very well, but she didn't actually know the animals in the forest that her mother was afraid of. Even though she didn't know them, she thought she must love them very much, too, because she loved all animals. She loved them the most because she saw them in her dreams.
    The days were very pleasant for Breeze. She loved her family and home very much. She thought she was a very lucky little girl.
    However, one day something bad happened. Early in the morning, Breeze and her family were having breakfast when the doorbell rang. Who could it be, this early in the morning? Breeze's mother rushed to the door. There at the door were three men, village guards: strong men of different ages.
    The men had a frightened look. Breeze's mother promptly invited them in and offered tea to the men who came. The oldest of the men leaned forward, and after catching his breath, began to explain in an excited and confused way,
    "We are so sorry to trouble you this time of the morning. However, something very bad has happened. A bear descended from the forest to the village. He roams around the village shouting. The villagers don't know what to do. Everyone is looking for a hole to hide in until he's gone. The bear screams so loudly that no one dares to come near it."
    Hearing this, Breeze and her family did not know what to say.
    Nothing like this had every happened in this village before. Everyone looked at each other in surprise. The oldest guardian of the village continued to speak:
    "We gathered as village guards and made a decision. We need to do something to stop this bear. Tonight, together with all the men of the village, we will seek and find the bear. We'll take time prisoner afterwards. We have no other choice. If we don't do this, he will hurt us."
    Hearing what the old guardian said, Breeze was very upset. They were going to take the bear prisoner. Breeze didn't want any animals imprisoned. She felt they all had to be free. Always. And while she had never met a bear before, she felt like she knew that the bear was not bad. Her heart said so.
    "All animals are good!" said Breeze's heart. If only she could see the bear and talk to him, she thought. If she met the bear, she though she would immediately talk to the bear and tell him to get away from the village in case he got hurt.
    After the village guards left, the mean of the house left to start their day. Breeze was home with her mother and grandma. She was very upset, and couldn't say a word. Seeing this state of her, her mother was also upset. She came to her daughter and asked:
    "You're feeling sorry for the bear. Aren't you, Breeze?"
    "Yes... they will take him prisoner."
    "I know Breeze, this is a very sad thing. However, sometimes we have to do sad things to protect ourselves and our loved ones. This is such a situation. If we don't take the bear prisoner, he will hurt us."
    "How do you know, mother? He hasn't hurt anyone so far. He was just shouting. That's what the old guardian said."
    "I heard him, too. Just because the bear hasn't done anything yet, doesn't mean he won't. Besides, it seems that he is always screaming and scaring people."
    "Maybe he has a problem, Ma!"
    "Breeze; even if he has a problem , no one can come near him because everyone is so afraid of him. There is nothing we can do. Sometimes in life there are moments like this. We must do what is right for the good of all. If only the bear could talk and tell us what he wanted, it might be different. However, animals can't talk, so it isn't possible."
    Breeze ran to her room in tears without saying anything else to her mother. Latte followed, too. Breeze hugged Latte and sobbed.
    "I don't want the bear to the imprisoned, Latte. He is not different from you! He can be my friend too. I love him, too. We haven't met yet, but I still love him very much. I don't want him to be imprisoned, just as I don't want you to be imprisoned, Latte. You understand me, don't you?" 
    Latte understood Breeze. She licked Breeze for a long time and then lay on her lap. They both fell asleep right there, at the foot of Breeze's bed.
    While Breeze was sleeping, she had a dream.
    In her dream she was in the forest. She was sitting under a huge cedar tree. The weather was beautiful and sunny. A pink picnic blanket was spread over the ground. There were also tea sets on the blanket. And a jar. A jar with honey in it. A bear was sitting across from Breeze. A big, brown hear. She was having a tea party with the bear. Breeze was spooning honey from the jar on the picnic blanket and offering it to the bear. The bear ate well, but it was as if he was a little sad. He had both eyes closed and was constantly rubbing his eyes. Breeze wondered and asked:
    "Did something happen to my teddy bear's eyes? And why do you look so sad?"
    Just then, it got dark in the forest. Dark clouds had come over Breeze and the bear. I started to rain in torrential form. The bear was saying something to Breeze, but Breeze couldn't hear him over the roar of the storm.
    "I can't hear you teddy bear. Say it again!"
    Breeze awoke to the mother's voice. Mother was calling her into the kitchen. Breeze looked around. It was already dark. Who knew how long she slept. "What a strange dream it was!" she thought. However, she felt much better now. She was very happy to see that dream. She didn't feel sad anymore. 
    Breeze went downstairs to the kitchen. Her mother was preparing the dinner table, and Breeze cheerfully helped her mother. Then her grandmother, mother and Breeze sat down to dinner.
    "Fathers will be arriving late tonight, Breeze; they're helping the village guards. So let's have our dinner," said her mother.
    Breeze's her broke again when her mother said that, but then she immediately remembered the dream she had. When she remembered the dream, she was filled with joy again.
    When they were almost at the end of their meal, and had begun to listen to an old story that Grandma was telling about a time she had healed a neighbour from blindness, a voice came from the door of their house. I sounded like someone was trying to open the door.
    Whenever there was a knock on the door or a sound, Latte would run to the door and start barking. However, Latte didn' do that this time. She ran to the door, but never barked. She sniffed the door a little, then came and sat down next to Breeze. She fixed her eyes on Breeze. It was as if she was upset about something and was asking Breeze for help.
    Meanwhile, the voices kept coming from the door. Strangely, whoever was at the door wasn't knocking or calling int. It was as if he was trying to open the door by reaching.
    Breeze, her mother and grandmother were staring at the door in amazement. The mother walked boldly towards the door and opened it softly. As she opened the door, she jumped back from where she was. The woman could not even speak out of fear. She quickly ran back to Breeze and Grandma.
    There was a bear at the door. A huge, brown bear was just standing there. He was growling, just as the village guards had told them. But in fact, it didn't sound like he was shouting so much as moaning. The poor bear was moaning like he was hurt.
    Breeze nearly swallowed her little tongue in surprise. Nobody was talking. The dream she had suddenly came to Breeze's mind. At that moment, her face lit up and she turned to her mother and said,
    "There is nothing to fear, mother! The bear is hurting, that's why he's been roaring."
    Granny took a few steps towards the bear. Then she sighed, "Yes, Breeze is telling the truth. I saw it carefully. Something has happened to both of its eyes. Gosh! What can we do? This poor animal is suffering..."
    Breeze immediately ran to her grandmother. "You can heal him, Grandma! You heal everyone. You can also heal the bear. You were just telling a story about how you healed the neighbour's eyes.. Please heal the bear, Grandma! Please!"
    "Breeze, I can heal him, but how do I approach him? What if he attacks me?"
    "No, Grandma! He won't attack. The bear come to ask for help. You already know that he hasn't attacked anyone. The village guard uncles said so. Nothing will happen. I will be with you. Bring your ointments as soon as possible."
    Grandma went straight to the room where her ointments were. Meanwhile, the teddy bear, who was in a state of pain, laid on the ground. Breeze slowly began to approach the bear. In fact, Breeze had never seen a bear before. She only say him in her dreams. Yet she was not afraid at all.
    Her mother, meanwhile, was very afraid. "Breeze, be careful my girl. Wat if the bear does something to you?"
    "Don't worry, Ma. I will talk to him."
    Then she said to the bear, "Dear teddy bear, I am among to heal you. Don't be afraid of me, okay? Soon my grandmother will come, too. She will put ointment on your wounds and you will be fine."
    The teddy bear continued to moan from where he was lying. Breeze got closer to the bear. She got down on her knees and started petting the bear's head. The bear didn't move at all. He wasn't doing anything to scare Breeze. He was lying down quietly.
    Grandma came to them after a while. When she looked closely, she saw that the bear's eyes looked very sore. She was a little afraid to touch the bear at first, but she immediately got over her fear and started to clean the bear's eyes well. Then she applied her ointments. The bear lay gently while she attended to him.
    When Grandma's work was done, the bear had already fallen asleep. Breeze and her grandmother left him to sleep. In the meantime, the mother brought some water and honey, and left them near to the bear, for him to eat when he woke up.
    Breeze, her mother and her grandmother were very worried that night though. They knew that when Breeze's father, grandfather and brothers returned, they would find the bear there and try to catch him. So they decided to wait for them at the table. Meanwhile, the bear was sound asleep and no longer groaned.
    Hours passed. Still the boys and men had not returned. Breeze, her mother and grandmother couldn't stay awake any longer, and fell asleep where they were. A long time after, the door made a sound and they all jumped! Breeze's mother immediately leapt up to tell the returning family members what had happened, but what should she see? The bear was not there any more. The water and honey pots she left were also empty. The 'teddy bear' had his fill and left.
    Breeze's father said, "We searched the whole village but could not find the bear. We are very tired. We'll continue the search tomorrow." The Grandmother said, "Don't worry, son. You can't find the bear anymore. The bear came here with injured eyes. We treated him and he fell asleep. Shortly after that, we did too. We woke up when you came. The bear is long gone."
    The mean and boys looked at each other in amazement. All of this was unbelievable. The father looked at the mother curiously. Then Mother said, "Something astonishing also happened. Breeze seemed to be talking to the bear. Then she went to him and started to pet him. The bear stood still. Meanwhile, your mother treated him. I really don't think the bear will come back."
    And it was true. Nobody saw the bear again.
    Weeks passed, and Breeze and her family continued their happy lives. As the weather was cool, Breeze's family didn't spend much time in the garden. However, Breeze did: she loved the garden, and enjoyed running around with Latte.
    One day, at noon, Breeze and Latte were playing in the garden. Ma was cooking. Grandma was preparing on of her famous ointments. Big brothers were at school. Dad and Grandpa were out, as usual, but they were on their way home, since it was almost time for lunch.
    Breeze and Latte were playing very happily. Then, Latte suddenly stopped with a startle. She turned her head towards the road and started barking. Breeze couldn't understand why Latte was suddenly restless. Latte was barking with all her might.
    Breeze also looked towards the road and though she vaguely say someone. The garden of their house was very large, and at the end of the garden, she could see the beginning of the dirt road leading into the village. However, because the garden was so large, Breeze couldn't quite make out who she was seeing. In fact, she realised, it was time for her father and grandfather to come home, but Latte would never have barked if they were there. On the contrary, she would be happy and start running towards them.
    The stranger was fast approaching Breeze. Breeze could see him now. The person coming towards her was a strange man about her father's age. The man suddenly began to shout:
    "Call your father, girl! Is your father at home?"
    Breeze was stunned, not knowing what to say. The strange man was speaking very angrily. Breeze was scared.
    The man shouted again:
    "I'm telling you. Do not you hear? Call your father now!"
    Hearing the shouts, the mother and grandmother also went out and froze when they saw the strange man. His anger was making them frightened. But Latte was not frightened. She lashed out at the strange man. The loyal puppy would do anything to protect her family.
    The man kept shouting. "You healed the bear. Who are you to interfere in my business? You ruined all my plans. The bear was going to go blind in a few days, and I could easily catch him and take him prisoner. Then I could make him do whatever I want. I was going to make performances with the bear and make a lot of money. Do you know how much money I would have made? Of course, you don't. Why did you interfere in my business? Give me an answer. And while you're at it, give me the money I would earn if I had caught the bear!!!"
    The mother and grandmother began to tremble with fear. They didn't know what to do. The man was getting closer. As Breeze had never had such a thing happen to her in her whole life; she had no idea what was going on.
    But then, Breeze's father and grandfather appeared at the end of the garden. Seeing them, her mother and grandmother relaxed a little. Her father started running as soon as he saw the stranger. At the same time he was shouting:
    "Who are your? What are you doing in my garden?"
    The stranger replied at once:
    "I have come to take what is mine. You healed the bear I was going to catch. I was going to make a lot of money with him. I couldn't do it because of you. You will give that money to me. Otherwise, it will be very bad for you!"
    He was waving his hands menacingly as he uttered his last sentence. But Breeze's father was very brave, and jumped on the strange man with a fury. Immediately, Grandfather did, too. Latte also ran to them, barking, to help Father and Grandfather. Breeze, her mother and grandmother could see nothing but dust and smoke. And of course they heard the shouts.
    Suddenly Breeze decided to join them. She ran into the dust but something hit her and she heard a crack. She realised that she had broken her arm. Her mother and grandmother began to cry and scream. The men, who were fighting with each other, stopped fighting for a moment. Even Latte stopped barking and froze in place.
    Breeze lay pale and hurting on the ground. Just then, a howl was heard. And then the roar of the bear. Everyone turned and looked towards the forest. And what did they see? The brown bear they treated weeks ago came ambling into the garden. He was followed by a pack of wolves, along with many friendly rabbits, snakes, and butterflies. Together, they all descended into Breeze's garden.
    The bear started running towards the strange man. Seeing this, the stranger bean to run away without looking back. He disappeared in a very short time, and the villagers later caught him.
    But for now, the brown bear quietly approached Breeze and took her in his arms. All the forest animals came to stand beside him. Breeze's family watched the animals silently and curiously.
    While Breeze was being held warm in the bear's lap, a snake curled up on Breeze's arm. It wound around her arm and reset the bone. A moment later, Breeze opened her eyes again. When she saw that she was in the brown bear's lap, she knew that she was safe. And she noticed that her arm did not hurt any more. She smiled and hugged the bear tightly.
    The whole family was crying with happiness. Breeze was also very happy. She was very happy both to see the brown bear and other animals, and to know that everything was fine.
    The brown bear gently lowered Breeze from his lap. Then he slowly returned to the forest with the other animals. Breeze and her family watched the brown bear and his friends depart with a sense of wonder and awe.
    The strange man never harmed any animal again. Breeze also lived a very happy life forever with her family and animal friends.`,

    title: "Monica's Christmas Adventure",
    passage: `Monica tried her best to fight the drowsiness she felt while she sat on the stairs on Christmas Eve. She waited for Santa to come down the chimney so she could meet him. But it was almost midnight and Santa hadn't arrived yet. She grew worried. She though maybe she wasn't on his nice list. She began thinking back. She tried to remember if she had done something bad that year. But then, she heard a loud thud out in the backyard.
    Monica's heart raced. “Has Santa finally arrived?” she thought. She twisted the doorknob to open the door slightly, just enough for her to peek through just in case it wasn't Santa. She looked and saw something she didn't expect. It was a reindeer.
    Monica closed the door and ran upstairs to her room. It was cold outside so she needed her jacket. Once she got her jacket, she made her way back downstairs. She was careful not to make any noise so that she wouldn't wake her parents. She opened the door again and made her way outside. She shivered as the cold wind blew. She walked towards the reindeer and then she came to a half. The reindeer was bigger than any reindeer she had seen on the television. She was in awe of the reindeer's size.
    Monica moved a little closer and noticed that there was something wrong with the reindeer. The reindeer was breathing heavily. She looked around for any wounds but found none. She wasn't sure what was wrong with the reindeer. Then she remembered that every time she ran around the playground too much, she would breathe heavier than normal. Her dad would always give her a glass of water. So, she ran back inside and got a bowl of water for the reindeer.
    Monica hurriedly went back outside with a bowl of water. She was careful not to spill any of it. She walked slowly leaving another set of footprints on the snow. She placed the bowl near the reindeer's mouth. The reindeer moved slightly and started drinking. It only took a few moments for the reindeer to empty the bowl.
    Having its strength replenished, the reindeer got up. Monica took a step back and saw the reindeer tower over her. The reindeer looked mighty with its antlers. Then the reindeer bowed its head in front of her. It appeared to be a gesture of gratitude. She bowed her head in reply.
    The reindeer walked a few steps then stopped. The reindeer had found something. Monica, being little curious, checked to see what the reindeer found. She was surprised when she saw a Christmas bag full of gifts. She wanted to see whatever her gift was there so she took it all out of the bag. To her disappointment, none of the gifts were for her. It broke her heart a little.
    As Monica stood there with a gloomy look on her face, the reindeer slowly pushed a gift at her foot. She picked it up and saw that it was for a kid named Spencer. Puzzled by the reindeer's action, she said “This gift isn't for me.”
    The reindeer tapped the gift Monica was holding with its nose. Again, with a puzzled look on her face, she said “What do you want me to do with it?”
    The reindeer tapped the gift with its nose again. Monica, again puzzled by the reindeer's gesture, said “Do you want me to help you deliver all of this?”
    The reindeer raised its head. Monica finally understood what the reindeer wanted.
    She hesitated for a moment then realized that it was almost Christmas and other kids hadn't had their gifts delivered yet. It would also be hard for the reindeer to deliver the gifts on its own.
    “Okay Mr. Reindeer. I'll help you deliver all of these gifts.” Monica said.
    Monica placed all the gifts back in the bag and carried it on her back. The reindeer then picker her up by the hood of her jacket with its mouth and slowly settled her onto its back.
    “Wait, I don't know these kids. How are we supposed to know where to deliver them to?” Monica said.
    The reindeer lifted its head to reassure her that she didn't need to worry. Monica decided to trust the reindeer.
    When the reindeer got ready to take flight, Monica noticed that the reindeer's nose started glowing. Her eyes widened when she realized who the reindeer was. “Wait, are you---?” Before she could finish her question, the reindeer took flight and off they went.
    Monica was scared at the beginning of their journey. They flew through the starry sky. It was the highest she had ever been. She was afraid to look down at first. The when she saw how beautiful it was, all her fear simply disappeared.
    Rudolph made his way down and landed in front of a house. The house was filled with lights and decorations. Monica wasn't sure which gift was for the kid in that house. But before she could ask Rudolph, one of the gifts started to glow.
    She took out the gift and read that it was for Caroline. The gift then began to separate from her grasp and slowly float towards the chimney and disappeared.
    It was the most amazing thing she had ever seen. Rudolph then took flight and they were off to another house.
    With every house they went to and with every gift she saw flying into the house through the chimney, her heart grew fuller and happier. She forgot about the sadness she felt when she realized that her gift hadn't come yet or may never come. All she though about while they flew through the night sky was how they needed to deliver these gifts so that everyone could have gifts to open on Christmas morning.
    When they got to the last house, Monica was curious and wanted to know what would happen if she held onto the gift as it flew to the house. So, when the gift started flying, Monica held onto it as hard as she could. She soared to the roof of the house as she held onto the gift tightly. They came in through the chimney and landed safely inside the house. She saw the tree and walked quietly towards it.
    “Hello”
    Monica was startled and immediately turned around and found a little boy standing in front of him. He was rubbing his eyes. He had just awoken from his slumber.
    “Where's Santa?” the little boy said.
    Monica paused for a moment to think about what to say.
    “Santa...lost one of his gift bags so I'm delivering it for him with Rudolph.” Monica said.
    Monica knelt down and placed the gift under the tree.
    “Don't open your gift until Christmas morning, okay?” Monica said.
    The little body nodded.
    “What's your name?” Monica said.
    “Spencer.” The little boy said.
    “Come on Spencer. Let's get you back to bed.” Monica said.
    Monica held Spencer's hand and guided him to the stairs. She watched as he slowly made his way upstairs. When he finally disappeared, she smiled. Her heart grew a little fuller.
    Monica started levitating off the ground. She flew back to the chimney without her control. She went up and out and back to Rudolph safely. She glanced at the house one last time and then said “Let's go home Rudolph”.
    As they made their way home, Monica took the time to enjoy the view from the sky one last time. They flew through the night sky. She felt the cold wind brush through her face. She laughed as she welcomed its cold touch.
    Rudolph landed on their front lawn. Rudolph picked Monica up by the hood of her jacket and safely settled her down on the ground.
    Monica turned and was surprised when she saw her parents waiting for her at the front door. She walked to them slowly with her head down. She stopped in front of them and said “I'm sorry I left the house without telling you.”
    Monica's dad picked her up and both her parents gave her a tight hug.
    “We were so worried about you when we checked in your room and you were gone. But someone assured us that you were okay.” Her mom said.
    Monica's dad set her down and said “There's someone here who would like to meet you.”
    Before Monica could ask who, she heard gigantic footsteps coming from the side of the house. She turned and saw the largest man she had ever seen. The man was draped in red with a long white beard that reached up to his big round belly. It was him. It was Santa.
    “Ho! Ho! Ho! Here, little Monica.” Santa said.
    Monica remained silent. She was in awe of Santa. Without intending to, Monica's eyes suddenly watered and tears started flowing down her eyes.
    “I heard you took care of Rudolph.” Santa said.
    Monica nodded as she kept wiping the tears from her eyes.
    “It seems that you also delivered my gifts for me too.” Santa said.
    Monica nodded again, now wiping the snot coming out of her nose.
    Santa rubbed her head gently and said, “I would like to thank you for helping me deliver my gifts.”
    Monica stayed silent.
    “But there's one gift I haven't had the pleasure of delivering yet.” Santa said.
    Monica's heart raced as she heard Santa's words. She looked up and saw Santa holding a glowing gift. Santa handed the gift to her and she accepted it wholeheartedly. All of a sudden, she couldn't stop smiling.
    Monica gave Santa a big hug as they said their goodbyes. She stood beside her parents, holding her gift tightly in her arms, as they watched Santa hop on his sleigh. Rudolph, with his glowing red nose, gave her a nod.
    “Bye Santa! Bye Rudolph!” Monica said.
    Santa flew to the sky and said “Ho! Ho! Ho!” as he disappeared into the night sky.
    Monica slept beside her parents that night, thinking that was the best Christmas she's ever had.`,
